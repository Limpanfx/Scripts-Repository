# The Strongest Battlegrounds – Killfarm

Killfarm setup for the **Main-Game** using multiple accounts.

## Steps

1. Join the game on every account and execute the script on each.
2. On your alt accounts, press `Alt 1-4` sperately on each account, depending on how many alts you are using.
3. On your main account, press the `Main` button to start the farm.

## Notes

- This specific variation is hardcoded and only works for the user `Username` Exchange the username within the code to your main account.
- Do not have shiftlock enabled on your main account. The script adjusts your character angle during teleport, and shiftlock will interfere with that and break the alignment.
- Do not farm too much, it will certainly lead to a ban.

## Script
You can get the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Limpanfx/Scripts-Repository/refs/heads/main/The%20Strongest%20Battlegrounds/Main-Game/Killfarm/Script.lua), switch out Username with your username.
