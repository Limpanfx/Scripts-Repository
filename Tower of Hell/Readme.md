# Tower of Hell – Teleport Script

Tower of Hell script that automatically teleports your character through finish parts.

## ⚠️ Risk of ban

Using this script is **very** likely to result in a ban from:
- The specific game (Tower of Hell or related copies).
- The experience’s anticheat / moderation systems.

You use these scripts entirely at your own risk.  
Do **not** run them on accounts or inventories you care about.

## What the script does

- Teleport the local player through `workspace.tower.finishes` children to simulate stage completion.
