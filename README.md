# Scripts-Repository

A small **collection** of my Roblox exploit scripts, organized after game.  
Most scripts are meant to be executed with modern Roblox executors that support `loadstring` and `game:HttpGet`.

> Use everything at your own risk. I am not responsible for bans, data loss, or any issues caused by these scripts.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is structured per-game, and sometimes with a universal category:

- `Universal/` - Scripts and utilities that work in multiple games (e.g. UI, utilities, general ESP, QoL).
- `<GameName>/` - Scripts targeting a specific game.
- Inside each game folder you may find:
  - `Script.lua` - Name can depend, but will end in ".lua".
  - `Readme.md` - Describes the script or how to execute it.
