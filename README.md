# Scripts-Repository

A small **collection** of my Roblox exploit scripts, organized after game.  
Most scripts are meant to be executed with modern Roblox executors that support `loadstring` and `game:HttpGet`.
Scripts are specifically made for low UNC executors, but can be outdated.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is structured per-game, and sometimes with a universal category:

- `Universal/` - Scripts and utilities that work in multiple games (e.g. UI, utilities, general ESP, QoL).
- `<GameName>/` - Scripts targeting a specific game.
- Inside each game folder you may find:
  - `Script.lua` - Is the script. Name can depend, but will end in ".lua".
  - `Readme.md` - Describes the script or how to execute it.

## 🙏 Requesting

The scripts listed will only be listed if my influence is involved, but you can request scripts for games or inform me of bugs [here](https://discord.com/users/998734989279633438).

## 👤 About me

I go by **Limpan**, and I mainly script Roblox exploits for fun, learning, and QoL automation in the games I play.  
Most of what you see here starts as something I make for myself first, then clean up and release if it’s stable enough.

I enjoy experimenting with new ideas, optimizing scripts, and making things as smooth and minimal as possible.
