# What Is a Roblox Executor?

A Roblox **executor** is a third‑party program that injects and runs custom Lua scripts inside the Roblox client. It is not made or approved by Roblox.

## What They Do

- Execute client‑side scripts (ESP, autofarm, custom GUIs).  
- Read/modify local instances (your character, camera, UI).  
- Fire remotes and run code from URLs via `loadstring` + `HttpGet`.

## Risks & Warnings

- **Against Roblox rules** - Your account can be warned or banned.  
- **Malware risk** - Many executors contain viruses, miners, or steal cookies.  
- **Privacy risk** - They have access to your Roblox session and system.

Use only on throwaway alts, never trust executors that ask for login info, and always treat them as potentially unsafe software.
*I will not list any executors here since I am unaware of how safe they are to use.*
